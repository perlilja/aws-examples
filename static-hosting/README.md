# Static hosting with Route53, S3 and Cloudfront

In this example we will create a static web page with React and upload it to S3. Then create a custom domain name 
in Route53 and point it to our new static web page. As a last step we will turn on caching with Cloudfront.

## Create the static web app with React
Start by creating a new app on your own or use the existing tictactoe app that I have created.
